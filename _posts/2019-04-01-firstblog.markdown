### Roadmap to ML and DL
This is my learning path to Machine Learning and Deep Learning

> ""The brain sure as hell doesn't work by somebody programming in rules. -Geoffrey Hinton""

The way i just follow is top down method and its hardway to understand but its more efficient that any other .
First we should know the basics whats is ML and whats is DL and its classification I just came through internet and get this image to classify both ML and Dl in 

### Artificial Intelligence
Difference in AI and ML subset of AIHere we can see that Artificial intelligence is a combination of Ml and Dl And NN

In previous days Arthur Lee Samuel who invented the term Machine Learning and the Checkers -program was the first successful machine learning program
Later many came and get eager in this field the hype word ML came into the world .

So for learning Ml i am suggesting some self paced ML resources which is world class

For learning there is a path i just follow the top down here first i am mentioning from NN →DL →Ml →Maths →Python..sorry to say this may be very awkward but beleive me it works

**For Machine learning**
  1. [Andrew Ng Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
  2. [Fast.ai](http://course18.fast.ai/ml)
  3. [Google Machine Learning crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)
  4. [Machine Learning tutorial form kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/machine-learning-tutorial-for-beginners)

**Deep learning resources**
 1. [MIT Introduction to deep learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)
 2. [fast.ai](http://course18.fast.ai)	
 3. [Deep learning- Coursera(Andrew Ng)](http://coursera.org/)


**BLOG**

Rather than going for tutorials i mostly used to read blog, because bloggers mostly express their outcomes by writing so yes that's why i am here to express my outcome here

The highly curated blog like

1. [colah blog](http://colah.github.io/)
2. [karpathy blog](http://colah.github.io/)
3. [distill](http://distill.pub/)
   
And one blog which i loved most  otoro hadmaru [blog](http://blog.otoro.net/)


**GITHUB repos**

 The best Github resources that gives you free code tutorials as well as an idea that how to code.

   1. A top-down, practical guide to learn AI, Deep learning and Machine Learning [here](https://github.com/geekylax/How-to-learn-Deep-Learning.com)

   2. A curated list of awesome Machine Learning frameworks, libraries and software. [here](https://github.com/geekylax/awesome-machine-learninggithub.com)

   3. PyTorch Tutorial for Deep Learning Researchers.[here](https://github.com/geekylax/data-science-ipython-notebooks)

   4. Data science Python notebooks: Deep learning (TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, Keras), scikit-learn, Kaggle, big data spark [here](https://github.com/geekylax/TopDeepLearning)

   5. A list of popular github projects related to deep learning [here](https://github.com/geekylax/TopDeepLearninggithub.com)


   6. Deep Learning and deep reinforcement learning research papers and some codes [here](https://github.com/endymecy/awesome-deeplearning-resourcesgithub.com)


   7. Top 200 deep learning Github repositories sorted by the number of stars [here](https://github.com/mbadry1/Top-Deep-Learninggithub.com)


   8. A curated list of awesome Deep Learning tutorials, projects and communities. …github.com
       
    And also check out my github repo [here](https://github.com/geekylax)__

  
  Here i mentioned some awesome repos for Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning also some beautifully documented NLP resources
  
  check out forked repos [here](https://github.com/geekylax?tab=repositories) which are most important and starred repo here which are in construction
  
  I am doing some projects tutorials form what i learn from the resources mentioned above [here](https://github.com/geekylax/Projects_from_Tutorials)

### WEBSITES
   Websites which are useful to learn
 
 1. [Analytics vidhya](https://analyticsvidhya.com/)
 2. [kdnuggets](https://analyticsvidhya.com/)
 3. [superdatascience](https://www.superdatascience.com/)
 4. [datasciencecentral](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/)
 5. [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/)


### YOUTUBE Resources
   The best youtube video tutorials that i inspired a lot
  
 1. [sirajraval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)

 2. [move37](https://www.theschool.ai/courses/move-37-course/)

   sorry to say this the one and only siraj is best for youtube resources you can get most of learnings here

### MATH resources
   Basic Maths tutorials resources are useful to get an idea sorry to say this i get to do this at last after doing these above steps

1. [khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home)
2. [3blue1brown](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home)
3. [fastai numeric algebra ](https://www.fast.ai/2017/07/17/num-lin-alg/)

So yes tatsol after finishing these tutorials i am doing research in quantum computing for Deeplearning So i will post my knowledge in my upcoming post


    
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
